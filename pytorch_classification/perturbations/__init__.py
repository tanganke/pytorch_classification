"""
This module contains classes and functions for generating perturbations on input data for use in machine learning models.
Perturbations can be used to improve model robustness and generalization by introducing small variations to the input data.
The module includes various types of perturbations such as noise, blur, and rotation, which can be applied to images and other types of data.
